				For package collections, among which is <a href="https://pypi.org">Python Package Index</a> aka PyPI, it's crucial to provide complete metadata on published packages in an easily accessible way and easily processable format. For instance, it's required by <a href="https://repology.org">Repology</a> to be able to report outdated versions of Python modules packaged in distributions native repositories.
				</p>

				<p>
				Unfortunately, PyPI does not currently provide such data in an usable way. According to the <a href="https://pypi.org/help/#integrating">FAQ</a> and <a href="https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/index.html#available-apis-datasets">PyPI API Reference</a>, there are several ways to access package metadata:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html#project">An endpoint</a> to get information on individual project - not suitable as it requires thousands of HTTP requests to fetch data on all packages.</li>
					<li><a href="https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/xml-rpc.html">XML-RPC API</a> which has the same problem.</li>
					<li><a href="https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/legacy.html#simple-project-api">Simple Project API</a> which has the same problem and does not provide any information apart from downloads.</li>
					<li><a href="https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/bigquery-datasets.html">BigQuery Datasets</a> which require Google account for access.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				None of these meet basic usability requirements. A simple single-file package metadata dump would be sufficient, but for some reason PyPI developers do not care (related upstream issues <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/347">pypa/warehouse#347</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/7403">pypa/warehouse#7403</a>) to provide such file, so this service was set up to provide at least something - that is, a metadata dump for recently changed packages only.
				</p>
				<p>
				The format of the following file is <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">zstandard</a>-compressed JSON containing an array of outputs of <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/json.html#project">Project</a> PyPI JSON API endpoint. Each package entry is additionally processed to remove <i>description</i> field and <i>release</i>s which are not the latest release (as specified by the <i>version</i> field) to reduce the size of the dump.
				</p>

				<div class="dump-block">
					<a class="dump-link" href="%FILENAME%">Download the latest dump</a>

				</div>

				<h2>Details of operation</h2>
				<p>
				This service works by polling XML-RPC <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/xml-rpc.html#mirroring-support">changelog</a> method to discover all package changes since the previous iteration, and then retrieves fresh metadata for each of them from <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/json.html#project">JSON API</a>. This information is then stored in the database and periodically dumped into a single JSON file.
				</p>
				<p>
				Source code is located on <a href="https://github.com/AMDmi3/pypicache">GitHub</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>Warranty</h2>
				<p>
				Note that <b>this service by design provides incomplete data</b>, <b>no consistency guarantee is ever provided</b> and <b>you're using this data at your own risk</b>. Additionally, note that XML-RPC API of PyPI is also <a href="https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/xml-rpc.html">deprecated</a> with a suggested replacement of <a href="https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/feeds.html#latest-updates-feed">Latest Updates</a> RSS feed, which only provides 40 latest changes without a mechanism to request larger history of updates, which <b>cannot</b> be used in a way that no updates are lost, so this service will be discontinued as soon as XML-RPC API is disabled.
